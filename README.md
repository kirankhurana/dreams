**I usually tend to remember dream more vividly during periods where I feel particularly anxious. My final project stems from the dreams I used to have about computer science when I took Intro to Programming. I felt like I was dreaming in bad code - warped symbols, broken loops, and error messages of “invalid syntax”. Now that I am not so anxious in my experience of computer science, I want to explore manifesting this kind of nervous energy by coding three different dreamscapes.**
