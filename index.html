<h1><a href="https://kirankhurana.art/">Bad Computer Science</a></h1>

<p>I usually tend to remember dream more vividly during periods where I feel particularly anxious. My final project stems from the dreams I used to have about computer science when I took Intro to Programming. I felt like I was dreaming in bad code - warped symbols, broken loops, and error messages of “invalid syntax”.</p>

<p>Now that I am not so anxious in my experience of computer science, I want to explore manifesting this kind of nervous energy by coding three different dreamscapes.
</p>
	
<p>For the interface, I want to include my CS Monsters - three masks I made in an earlier exploration of these dreams. </p>

<p>Each of the dreams will take up the entire browser window. </p>

<p>I might limit user interactivity to only one of the pages, mimicking the lack of control we have over our dreams when we sleep. </p>

<p>I want to create a cubemap, and SVG shapes made using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>I will use video, animations, and pixel manipulation to create movement that appears turbulent.</p>

<p>I am also curious to see if I can create a point on stillness with organic lines, symmetry, and continuous loops. </p>
