<!--<p>I usually tend to remember dream more vividly during periods where I feel particularly anxious. My final project stems from the dreams I used to have about computer science when I took Intro to Programming. I felt like I was dreaming in bad code - warped symbols, broken loops, and error messages of “invalid syntax”. Now that I am not so anxious in my experience of computer science, I want to explore manifesting this kind of nervous energy by coding three different dreamscapes. For the interface, I want to include my CS Monsters - three masks I made in an earlier exploration of these dreams. Each of the dreams will take up the entire browser window. I might limit user interactivity to only one of the pages, mimicking the lack of control we have over our dreams when we sleep. I want to create a cubemap, and SVG shapes made using Adobe Illustrator. I will use video, animations, and pixel manipulation to create movement that appears turbulent.I am also curious to see if I can create a point on stillness with organic lines, symmetry, and continuous loops. </p> -->
